    "# Eigenstate Labeling by Branch Analysis \n",

Besides its original purpose for understanding the dynamics during dispersive readout of a qubit, it is a systematic method to label eigenstates even for strongly interacting systems, where a simple \"labeling by overlap\" strategy is not applicable.\n",

    "## Basic Procedure of Branch Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Branch analysis associates the eigenstates with bare product state labels $(t, n)$, with $t$ and $n$ being the excitations in the transmon and resonator, respectively. It is performed in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We begin with identifying an eigenstate of the system with the largest overlap with a bare product state $|0,0\\rangle$ and label it by $|\\overline{0,0}\\rangle$.\n",
    "2. For each bare label $(0, n)$, we find the corresponding eigenstate $|\\overline{0,n}\\rangle$ recursively, starting from $n=1$:  \n",
    "    a) Put one resonator excitation on a labeled eigenstate $|\\overline{0,n-1}\\rangle$, which yields a new state $|\\psi_e\\rangle = a^\\dagger |\\overline{0,n-1}\\rangle$;  \n",
    "    b) Among all the unlabeled eigenstates, identify the eigenstate $|\\psi_g\\rangle$ with the largest overlap with $|\\psi_e\\rangle$;  \n",
    "    c) Label $|\\psi_g\\rangle$ by $|\\overline{0,n}\\rangle$;  \n",
    "    d) Repeat the steps a)—c) until $n=N-1$, where $N$ is the dimension of the truncated Hilbert space of the resonator mode. This procedure yields a set of eigenstates $\\{|\\overline{0,n}\\rangle\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$ corresponding to the transmon initialized in the ground state, and such set is called a branch.\n",
    "3. To find other branches with different transmon excitations, we repeat the step 2 for different initial eigenstates $|\\overline{1, 0}\\rangle$, $|\\overline{2, 0}\\rangle$, etc. These initial eigenstates are found as follows:  \n",
    "    a) Put one transmon excitation on a given labeled eigenstate $|\\overline{t-1,0}\\rangle$. For a transmon (and any other non-linear modes), we define the excitation operator \n",
    "    $$E = \\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} |t\\rangle\\langle t-1|,$$ \n",
    "    where $T$ is the dimension of the transmon's Hilbert space. The corresponding excited state is given by $|\\psi_e\\rangle = E |\\overline{t-1,0}\\rangle$;  \n",
    "    b) Among all the unlabeled eigenstates, identify the eigenstate $|\\psi_g\\rangle$ with the largest overlap with $|\\psi_e\\rangle$, which is labeled as $|\\overline{t,0}\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure summarizes the procedure for performing branch analysis for a system with $T=3$ and $N=4$: the numbers in front of each eigenstate show the order in which these states are labeled, and each arrow indicates how a labeled eigenstate is excited to help identify and label the next eigenstate.\n",
